# Podcast Downloader
Wanna download a podcast but they don't provide a download link? This attempts to solve that problem.

This is currently a very early version (v0.0, lol) that aims to facilitate the downloading of podcasts that don't normally offer download links (or require you to sign up or some other such nonsense). The idea is to provide the script with a text file where each line is a link to the podcasts "front page" from which all the episodes can befound. Currently just making this thing work and maybe implementing classes for each site.
